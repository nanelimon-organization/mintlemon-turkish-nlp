Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Follow these steps to set up Mint & Lemon Turkish NLP Library for local development:

1. Fork the `mintlemon-turkish-nlp` repository on GitHub.  
2. Clone your fork locally using the following command:

    $ git clone https://github.com/your_github_username/mintlemon-turkish-nlp.git

3. Create a new branch for your local development by running the following command:

    $ git checkout -b branch-name

   This will allow you to make changes locally without affecting the master branch.

4. Make the necessary changes and commit them to the branch using the following commands:

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."

5. Push the changes to your forked repository on GitHub by running the following command:

    $ git push origin branch-name

6. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website to have your changes reviewed and potentially merged into the main repository.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure that it meets the following guidelines:

1. We strongly recommend creating a dedicated branch when modifying core features. This allows for easy testing by others and can then be merged into the **main** branch.
   
2. If you are adding a new feature, function, etc., be sure to write test cases before submitting a pull request.
   
3. Not all tests may be necessary for a given modification to the source code.
   
4. If the pull request adds functionality, the documentation should be updated. Be sure to include a docstring for new functionality and update the documentation if necessary. (use: numpy-docstring style)

5. The pull request should be compatible with Python versions  3.8 => || <= 3.10.
