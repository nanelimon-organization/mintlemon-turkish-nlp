Roadmap and Future Plans
========================

The Mint & Lemon Turkish NLP Library is under active development and we have several plans for the future. Our main goal is to continue to improve the functionality and usability of the library, while also expanding its capabilities to cover new NLP tasks and applications. Here are some of the key features and improvements that we are currently working on or plan to implement in the near future:

* ``New NLP tasks:`` We are currently working on adding support for new NLP tasks such as named entity recognition, text summarization, and machine translation. These tasks will be integrated into the library in a way that is easy to use and consistent with the existing functionality.

* ``Improvements in performance and scalability:`` We are working on improving the performance and scalability of the library, especially for large datasets and high-volume use cases. This will involve optimizing the existing algorithms and models, as well as adding support for distributed computing and parallel processing.
  
* ``Expanded documentation and tutorials:`` We will be expanding the documentation and tutorials to cover new features and use cases, as well as providing more detailed explanations and examples.

* ``Support for deep learning and neural networks:`` We plan to add support for deep learning and neural networks to the library in the future. This will involve integrating popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, and developing new models and algorithms for NLP tasks.
Evaluation and benchmarking: We will be conducting more detailed evaluations and benchmarking of the library to measure its performance and accuracy, as well as comparing it to other popular NLP libraries.
